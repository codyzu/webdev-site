# Cloud

What is the cloud?

![cloud computing](./images/cloud.png)

The cloud is made up of managed computing resource, services and storage. When creating a cloud application, the goal is to save time by not needing to configure servers and possibly save money by not needing to purchase computer hardware.

There are three large cloud providers:
- Amazon AWS
- Google Cloud Services
- Microsoft Azure

Cloud services are generally billed using a "pay-as-you-go" model, meaning you pay for the resources used.
